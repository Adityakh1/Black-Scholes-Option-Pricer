# Black-Scholes Option Pricer
This is a small Python project that calculates **call and put option prices** using the Black-Scholes formula.  
I built it to understand how options work and how things like **volatility, time, and risk free interest rates** affect their prices.  


## Features
- Calculate **Call and Put prices** for European options   
- Can calculate **multiple options in one run**  
- Prints a **clear summary** of inputs and results  


## How to Use
1. Make sure **Python 3.x** is installed  
2. Run the file `pricer.py`  
3. Enter stock price, strike price, time to maturity, risk-free rate, and volatility  
4. Follow up
